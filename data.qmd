# Data Sets {-}

## Scope {-}

For the Amazon biome, the LUC-Brasil repository implements a comprehensive land cover classification system using Landsat satellite imagery from 1996 to 2022. The system produces annual land cover masks through a multi-stage pipeline that combines machine learning classification, temporal rule processing, and year-specific refinement using reference datasets from PRODES and TerraClass. The repository processes 25 years of historical data (2000-2025) and generates classified masks at 30-meter resolution, supporting deforestation monitoring and land use analysis in the Amazon region.

## Image Data {-}

The classification uses Landsat imagery from two distinct sources, each optimized for different temporal periods. This stage produces regularized datacubes with consistent 30m spatial resolution and regular temporal intervals.

### GLAD Landsat Historical Data {-}

Historical data for years 2000 to 2015 uses the GLAD (Global Land Analysis & Discovery) service accessed through the OGH (OpenGeoHub) interface. The regularization process aggregates observations into bi-monthly periods. The OGH (OpenGeoHub) service provides access to historical Landsat imagery through the GLAD (Global Land Analysis & Discovery) processing system. This source is used for historical datacube generation.

### BDC Recent Landsat Data {-}

The Brazil Data Cube (BDC) provides access to recent Landsat imagery through a pre-processed, analysis-ready data cube infrastructure maintained by INPE (Brazilian National Institute for Space Research). Recent data from 2015-2024 leverages the Brazil Data Cube (BDC) infrastructure, which provides higher temporal density with monthly aggregation.

## Map Data Sources {-}

This section lists the maps used in the LUC-Brasil project as additional information, mostly as masks to improve the spatial and temporal accuracy of the result. 

### PRODES Deforestation Data {-}

PRODES (Programa de Monitoramento do Desmatamento na Amazônia Legal) is Brazil's official deforestation monitoring program, maintained by INPE. It provides annual deforestation polygons for the Legal Amazon region. PRODES masks are referenced by multiple reclassification rules throughout the year-specific mask generation process. 

**Technical Specifications**

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Temporal coverage | 2000-2025 |
| Update frequency | Annual |
| Spatial resolution | Vector polygons and raster mask |
| Key attributes | Deforestation year, forest/non-forest classification |
| Usage context | Forest mask generation, deforestation reclassification rules |

### Terraclass Land Cover Surveys {-}

Terraclass is a land use and land cover mapping project for the Brazilian Legal Amazon, produced by INPE and Embrapa. Unlike PRODES (annual), Terraclass provides detailed land cover classifications at specific survey years. Terraclass provides detailed land cover classifications that are used for various reclassification rules. 

**Technical Specifications**

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Survey years | 2004, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2018, 2020, 2022 (8 surveys) |
| Update frequency | Irregular |
| Spatial resolution | Vector polygons and raster maps|
| Key classes | Silviculture, Pereniall, Semiperennial and Annual agriculture, Urban area, Water |

### Water Masks {-}

Water masks are used in temporal consistency rules to identify persistent water bodies across multiple years. These are primarily utilized in temporal processing rules rather than base mask preparation.

**Technical Specifications**

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Primary source | Terraclass water class |
| Temporal window | 2000-2025 |
| Purpose | Identify stable water bodies vs. temporary flooding |


## Sample Datasets {-}

This section lists the ground samples used by the LUC-Brasil project team as initial sources to select the training data used to build the modules for classification. These data sets are openly available in the Github repository [lulcbrasil-samples](https://github.com/restore-plus/lulcbrasil-samples).
